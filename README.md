Comprehensive User Management with Spring Boot:

This refined explanation incorporates user interaction methods (endpoints), responses, inputs, and potential errors:

	***FOR FURTHER REFERENCES PLEASE FOLLOW :  Swagger-UI ( http://localhost/swagger-ui/index.html );

1.User Model (package com.somrik.Makersharks.dto):

  Functionality: 
    The User.java class defines the data structure representing a user entity. It includes attributes like:
      id (int): Unique identifier (likely auto-generated by the database).
      name (String): User's name with validation for length (3-25 characters) and format (letters only).
      username (String): User's username with validation for length (5-10 characters) and format (alphanumeric characters and underscores).
      email (String): User's email address with validation for format.
      mob (long): User's mobile number with validation for a specific range (likely for a particular country's format).
      password (String): User's password with validation for complexity (minimum 8 characters, including upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).
	  
2.User_Controller (package com.somrik.Makersharks.controller):
    Develeoped For accepting and handling endpoint request and send response by using @Controller annotation.

3.User_Service (package com.somrik.Makersharks.service):
    For writing business logics separately from Controler and send proper message on operation commpletion or failure ,annotated with @Service annotation;.

4.User_Dao (package com.somrik.Makersharks.dao):
    For performing CRUD operations on Database by with the help of methods provide by JPARepository<User><Integer>, annotated with @Repository annotation;

5.UserRepository  (package com.somrik.Makersharks.repository) :
    Inherits JPARepository<User><Integer> and contains abstract methods, those are privodes to User_Dao class object to perfi=orm CRUD operations.

6.AES  (package com.somrik.Makersharks.helper) :
    It is a class that provides static methods encrypt() and decrypt() to make password secure while storing to database.

7.GlobalExceptionHandler (package com.somrik.Makersharks.exceptionHandler) :
    Annotated with @RestControllerAdvice ,to accept all the  RunTime Expections and handling them by sending to particular methods annotated with @ExceptionHandler for particular Exception and send message.

8.UserRegistrationApiApplication( package com.somrik.Makersharks) :
    Annotated with @SpringBootApplication,that Configures and covers all the sub packages to create objects for the consisting classes.


   

***Running Application:
    1.Start the application by running the UserRegistrationApiApplication(@SpringBootApplication), by selecting Spring Boot .
	2.Send the endpoint requests from POSTMAN with required inputs,if required and get the response in back within POSTMAN.
    3.Or after starting server, simply put " http://localhost/swagger-ui/index.html " url to browser to see response by SWAGGER UI.


These are the following modules:>

Module 1: User Registration ->
Endpoint:
       A POST request to "/api/user/register".
Input:
       You'll need to provide a JSON request body containing a User object with all attributes populated.

     JSON :
     {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "username": "johndoe123",
      "email": "johndoe@example.com",
      "mob": 1234567890,
      "password": "StrongPassword123!"
      }
   
Response:
      On successful registration (status code: 201 Created):
      The response will be a ResponseEntity object containing a ModelMap.
      The ModelMap will typically include a success message and potentially the saved user details (depending on the implementation).
      On encountering errors (e.g., username/email/mobile number already exists, validation errors):
      The response will be a ResponseEntity object with an appropriate status code indicating the error (e.g., 409 Conflict for existing user, 400 Bad Request for validation errors).
      The ModelMap within the response will contain an error message describing the issue.

Error Possibilities:
      1.A user with the provided username, email, or mobile number already exists in the system.
      2.The user object fails validation checks due to missing fields, invalid formats, or not meeting password complexity requirements.

Module 2: User Retrieval by Username ->
Endpoint: 
      A GET request to likely /api/user/fetch/{username} (or a similar endpoint for user retrieval). Here, {username} is a path variable representing the username to retrieve.
Input:
    No request body is required in this scenario.
    The username is extracted from the path variable {username} provided in the URL.

Response:
   On successful retrieval (status code: 200 Found):
   The response will be a ResponseEntity object containing a ModelMap.
   The ModelMap will typically include the retrieved user data.
   On encountering an error (status code: 404 Not Found):
   The response will be a ResponseEntity object with a 404 Not Found status code.
   The ModelMap within the response will contain an error message indicating the user with the provided username was not found.

Error Possibility:
      The user with the provided username doesn't exist in the system.
